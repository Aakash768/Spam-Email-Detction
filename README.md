# Spam Email Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based spam email detection system that can accurately classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide reliable email classification.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Support for multiple classification algorithms
- Model persistence for easy deployment
- Performance metrics evaluation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-detection.git
cd spam-email-detection
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
```python
from utility.data_processing import load_and_preprocess_data

# Load and preprocess the data
data = load_and_preprocess_data('path_to_your_data.csv')
```

2. Training Models:
```python
from utility.models_training import train_model

# Train the model
model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
```

3. Evaluation:
```python
from utility.model_evaluation import evaluate_model

# Evaluate model performance
metrics = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
```

## Model Performance
The system uses various machine learning algorithms and achieves competitive performance metrics:
- High accuracy in spam detection
- Balanced precision and recall
- Robust performance on unseen data
